# Personal VIM Setup

I've readjusted this setup quite a bit. I was using Textmate for a bit
but found I was doing so much server work it was hard to switch back and
forth.  Plus, most of the functionality in Textmate is available in Vim
and I am considerably faster at moving around using Vim than with
Textmate.

So I refactored. Mostly I copied the amazing work
[here](http://github.com/carlhuda/janus). The Rakefile there is exactly
what I am using, besides I think one change.  I am using my own vimrc
file though that I've had for years.

I love regenerating entire environments, no need to copy this stuff
around.

This is the way to do things, now I just need to look at doing it for
other things. Being able to easily regen my entire Vim infrastructure
rocks.
